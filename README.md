This project is a Chess Engine written in c++, it uses bitboards to represent the board aswell as binary operations for the movement of pieces.

The engine currently uses a simple alpha-beta pruning method, aswell as a quiescence search after this. Also some move ordering is used to increase efficiency significantly. 

The project is not finished, however I thought I should learn how to use github and so have created this repository to learn more about using git and github.
