This project is a Chess Engine written in C++, it uses bitboards to represent the board aswell as binary operations for the movement of pieces. I started this project because I am specifically interested in learning more about the applications of algorithms aswell as object oriented programming so this seemed like a very good excercise.

The engine currently uses a simple alpha-beta pruning method, aswell as a quiescence search after this so that the first search doesn't finish on a blunder. Also some move ordering is used to increase efficiency significantly. 

The project is not finished, however I thought I should learn how to use github and so have created this repository to learn more about using git and github.

Credit should go to Sebastian Lague an amazing programming youtuber, he inspired me to start this project and was a big help in understanding how to approach it.
